## Generating graphics

Using [stable-diffusion-online](https://stablediffusionweb.com/#ai-image-generator) following graphical elements were generated:

1. Background image (Guidance Scale:8-12):
You could try tinkering with Guidance Scale but values from 8-12 worked best for me.
```
artistic, evening, night time, new York, American, street, suburbs, crosswalk, road,
lanes, parked cars, neighborhood, break dance gang, pavement, side walk, horizontal,
parallel, left-to-right, houses, ground level, skyline, houses row, view from side,
street lights, night, ground point of view, houses, fire-safety stairs, ghetto 
```
2. Car models (Guidance Scale:7-9)
Figuring this one out was kinda hard, but in the end I've got what I wanted after about 30 tries. After getting the car image I removed background using some online services and mirrored it horizontally.
```
car, from side view, moving, model, single car, right to left, no background,
dark background, uniform background, one, american, dodge, old, side
```
## Generating source code

Can you write the FastApi app.py script that obliges the minimum requirements?
Minimum Requirements:
Implement GET requests to retrieve information about the service.
Implement POST requests to send messages.
Implement PUT requests to like messages.
For now, messages should be stored in a Python list or dictionary (we will discuss databases later).
The PUT route should toggle the "like" and "dislike" states for messages.

Ok, everything looks working and nice lets keep it like that. However, I have several issues:

Although the api that you've given me is correct and working, I need it to be structurally connected to my frontend app, so I would be able to send request to this FastApi server. 

Let me first describe my frontend, so it would be easier to make adjustments to the code.
My frontend app is a messaging interface that consists of dialogues which user can create and which are listed to him and messages in theses dialogues.

In order to make this backend app compatible with my frontend we need to introduce dialogues. In essense we need two methods/API routes:

1) GET /dialogues : retrieve the list of all user dialogues
2) POST /create: create a new user dialogue
3) PUT /change{dialogue_id}: change the name of a dialogue by its ID

Next logical change would be rewriting all the code that is connected to use messages:
Messages should be retrieved from a dialogue, Messages should be posted in connection to one of the dialogues, Liking a message should be connected to a dialogue etc.

Can you now rewrite the code below so it would comply with new concepts I just introduced now? In addition I want you to comment on how to make all this more logical and to have a good structure. I am giving you some leeway on this.

I have two problems with your new code:

1) route to get dialogue messages is missing
2) for some reason when I am trying to send message in dialogue I get dialogue not found error. It seems like I can normally send messages before changing the dialogue. But after I change the dialogue name I can no longer send messages for changed names.

Can you fix those?
